If you're interested in learning [ExtJS](http://www.extjs.com) and by accident know some German, I can recommend you read an article I wrote together with my colleague [Stefan Botzenhart](http://blog.stefanbotzenhart.com/). The article is called '_Kombiniert: Ruby on Rails und Ext JS_' and is published in the famous [German IT magazine iX](http://www.heise.de/ix/) in their actual special edition called [Web on Rails](http://www.heise.de/kiosk/special/ix/09/01/).

In the article we explain the implementation of [meinkabinett](http://www.meinkabinett.de/), a web application where people can vote celebrities for the European government. The implementation uses a rich front-end written in ExtJS and is driven by a Ruby on Rails back-end.
