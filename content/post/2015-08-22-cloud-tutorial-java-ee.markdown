If you know standard Java and want to quickly learn something more about the core components of the Java Enterprise Edition (Servlets, JSP, JSF, CDI and EJB), you should have a look at this new tutorial I have written with Martin called [Cloud Tutorial - Java EE](http://www.turngeek.press/javaeeinaday/).  
We call it a [cloud tutorial](http://www.turngeek.press/what-is-a-cloud-tutorial/), because you learn everything step by step using an Online IDE. That way you don't have to struggle with any software configuration and you can directly start learning. 
You can work yourself in one day through the tutorial - if you now a quicker way to learn that much about Java EE, let us know. Happy coding!
