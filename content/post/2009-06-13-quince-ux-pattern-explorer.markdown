Just in case you don't already know it: [Quince](http://quince.infragistics.com/) - calls itself an UX Patterns Explorer and that's just what it is.

You want to improve the user experience of your applications? Just take a look at this marble. It contains a large number of [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_patterns) for creating great user interfaces.

Even the exploration part of this tool is innovative: The patterns are not only ordered alphabetically by name but can be found by the tasks the user wants to accomplish.
