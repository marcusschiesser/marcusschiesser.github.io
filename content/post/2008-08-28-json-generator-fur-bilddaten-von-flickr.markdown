Probably a few other guys did this before, but I had a boring train journey without any internet connection, so I used the bits from my [3D album example](/?p=67) and made a JSON generator for Flickr data. What does that mean? Just enter a search term and the program finds matching pictures on Flickr. If pictures have been found, a click on 'JSON' displays a JSON-encoded array with the URLs and labels of the pictures found. Just perfect to create some test data of pictures for Actionscript or Javascript.
