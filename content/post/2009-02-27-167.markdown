**Note:** This post has been updated for ExtJS 4.1

In the early development phase it is usually a good idea to provide a mockup that is not using real data but some dummy data from memory. To do that for a grid in ExtJS we need to create a record class first. For a person this might look like this:


    
    
    Ext.define('Person', {
        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',
        fields: ['firstName', 'lastName']
    });
    



Then we need a store where instances of the `Person` class will be stored:


    
    
    var people = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {
        model: 'Person',
        proxy: {
            type: 'memory',
            reader: {
                type: 'json',
                root: 'root'
            }
        }
    });
    people.load();
    



The store is initially loaded with data from `peopleProxy` which must be defined previously like this:

    
    
    var peopleProxy = new Ext.data.MemoryProxy({
        root: [{
            firstName: 'Homer',
            lastName: 'Simpson'}]
    });
    



If we want to replace this in a later development phase with real data, we simply replace this proxy with an `HttpProxy`, which might look like this:

    
    
    var peopleProxy = new Ext.data.HttpProxy({
        url: '/people.xml'
    }),
    



If we finally connect the store to a data grid, it looks like this:
