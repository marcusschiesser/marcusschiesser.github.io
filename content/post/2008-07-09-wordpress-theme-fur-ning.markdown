I've written a small [Ning-Theme for Wordpress](http://www.marcusschiesser.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ning.zip), for all the people who want to use a Wordpress blog with [Ning](http://www.ning.com/). After installation the blog automatically uses the same Look&Feel as the site created with Ning.

For installation you firstly must copy the `ning` folder to `/wp-content/themes` and activate the theme as usually. Afterwards you must modify the `config.php` file to fit the needs of your Ning site.

Right now, the theme is only available in German language, but on demand I'm happy to help with the development of a multilingual theme.
