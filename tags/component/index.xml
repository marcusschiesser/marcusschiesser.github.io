      <description>After having used the shiny new YUI3 library for a project, it&amp;rsquo;s about time to share my YUI3 experiences with you. For the project I built an item selector: A modal dialog is openend and the user has to select an item. After selection the dialog is closed and the selected item is passed to a callback function.
Here you can find the full source for the item selector. An example to use the selector can be as simple as this:</description>

      <description>Ext already provides a component to select multiple items. The thing I do not like about it is that it covers too much space on the screen. Therefore I thought of a component that initially looks like a combo box and then opens a new window to let the user select the items.
As a nice example tells more than thousand words - here it is:
As you can see, it is actually based on the component provided by the Ext examples.</description>

      <description>As I pointed out before, it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunately not possible to use Flex components as info windows for Google Maps. Another issue is that the map is not available as a Flex component itself, therefore it&amp;rsquo;s a bit complicated to use it in Flex. So I thought to address these issues in a little Google Maps API for Flex that you can download here under BSD license. With openFlexInfoWindows I also added a method that allows you to use multiple Flex components as info window at once - nicely seperated in tabs.</description>
