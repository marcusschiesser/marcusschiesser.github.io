      <description>It is said that in Java usually the easiest things are the hardest. The following is a nice example as it took me some time to figure out how to do it. I wanted to build a simple URL request based web service in Java that returns an JSON object. Yes, you can do that with a simple Servlet too, the advantage of using Axis2 is that you can also call your deployed services using SOAP without any configuration changes.</description>
