      <description>After deploying my Play 2.1.1 based application to Cloudbees, I had the problem that everyone could access it. Not very ideal if you want to restrict your program to only a single audience.
To solve the problem you would usually write a complicated user-based authentication system. Slightly an overkill, if you don&amp;rsquo;t need different users accessing your program at all. My idea was more that the user has to add an URL parameter with a secret key, the first time the application is called.</description>
